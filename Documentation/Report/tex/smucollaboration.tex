As a part of this project we have been collaborating with Singapore Management University.

\textbf{Primary goal:}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\bfseries G\arabic*:]
\item SMU and ITU students must negotiate and finalize the project web-service interface
\item SMU students must implement a working client for the basic requirements.
\item ITU students must implement and deploy agreed web-services.
\end{enumerate}

We are using Scrum, and therefore it was decided that our product owner together with a developer would be the main communication link. This was done to shield the rest of the team so that they could focus on developing.

During the first week of collaboration a set of functional requirements for the SMU client was formed and adapted into Share-it's existing requirements. Most requirements was already met and only a few new was added. The SMU requirements was prioritized and it was agreed that if requirements where not to be met due to time pressure, those with lowest priority would be omitted.

Next step was for our group to make interfaces suiting the requirements so that SMU could begin client development as rapidly as possible. This did not go as we hoped.

The SMU students were delayed from the start due to complications devouring our service interface. The issue were that SMU had chosen to use HTML5 and javascript which did not integrate very well with our WCF implementation. A lot of time was used trying to accommodate these issues, but finally they decided to change technology to ASP.net making the service usage easier.

Due to this delay the SMU group was under a lot of pressure getting their client done before the deadline. Along side this it was very difficulty for them to blindly code up against the interface. Looking back at this we could have accommodated this by making more thorough documentation, but the main problem was them waiting for the final implementation before starting the development resulting in only a week to implement the client.

This said we met the requirements given inside the time limit and they implemented a nice working client using our services leaving both ITU and SMU satisfied with the collaboration.
