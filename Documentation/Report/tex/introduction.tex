In this report we will describe the system we developed as part of the course \textit{Second Year Project: Software Development in Large Teams with International Collaboration(Spring 2014)} (BNDN). We will do this by first describing the business case for the system i.e. the overall goal of the system. Following that we will describe the system specifications derived from the business case. We will give a description of the system design we chose to fulfil the requirements and a description of how we tested that this was also the case.

Additionally we will describe the collaboration process with the team from Singapore Management University(SMU). This includes a description of our communication with the SMU team and the difficulties we encountered when negotiating the requirements of services as well as a reflection on the collaboration.

Finally we will reflect on the project as a whole and on how much we learned when held against the intended learning outcome of BNDN.
