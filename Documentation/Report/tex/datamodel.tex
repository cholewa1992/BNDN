When designing the data model there were several considerations to make. Firstly it was important to design a data model which was flexible enough to accommodate the demands of the SMU team. Secondly it was important to design a data model which was in as high a normal form as possible in order to reduce redundant data and the possibility of creating corrupt data.(WHY DID WE MAKE THE UPLOADER/OWNER OF A MEDIA ITEM A RELATION?!? NOW IT IS POSSIBLE FOR A MEDIA ITEM TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE UPLOADER/OWNER) !!!ADD THIRD THING HERE!!!!!!

Looking at the requirements for \textit{The System} we identified two major entities, namely the \textit{User} and \textit{Media Item}. Additionally we realised that we needed an entity representing a \textit{Client} in order for the \textit{ShareIt Back End} to be able to differentiate which \textit{Media Item}s belonged to which \textit{Client}. 

In order to make data model as flexible as possible we decided to add an entity for the type of the \textit{Media Item}
