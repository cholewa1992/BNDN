\section{Erroneous states}

In order to avoid implementation errors from leading to more errors through the software flow, Code Contract\footnote{Microsoft Research plug-in for .NET} has been implemented for checking preconditions and invariants.

In order to run assemblies compiled with Code Contract checking, the plugin is required. However since the system being developed exposes services, requiring this plug-in from implementors is not feasible.
