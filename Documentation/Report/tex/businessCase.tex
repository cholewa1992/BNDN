\section{Business case}
%It is difficult to break through as an artist since money is often a barrier as it is fairly expensive to release your work if you are not signed to a publisher. At the same time is difficult to get signed by a publisher since they will not sign a contract with an artist unless they are certain that there is a market for the art that the artist produces as a publisher's main focus is money. \textit{ArtShare} aims to accomodate this problem. With a publisher, the artist assigns the copyright of their art to the publisher, who then amongst other things collect royalties and distribute a share of these to the artist, license the art and promote the art to recording artists, film and television\footnote{``What is music publishing?'' - http://www.mpaonline.org.uk/FAQ}. The downside is that if you get a contract with a publisher they will take a big cut of your profits. This might result in work never being published.\\
It is difficult to break through as an artist without signing with a publishing company. Furthermore as a publisher's main motivation is money, they will not sign a contract with an artist unless they are certain that there is a market for the art. When signing with a publisher the artist is required to hand over his rights to the art and the publisher will then work to promote it, taking a share a it's profit.



\noindent ArtShare is a platform for artists to independently publish their work without having a huge portion of their profits consumed by the publisher. To maximize the artists' profit the platform will allow anyone to publish their own art and make it available for everyone to buy and enjoy. ArtShare will work for sharing music, movies and books. Furthermore the platform should provide easy promotion of art which is popular among its users through its own promotion techniques as well as integration with various social media outlets. In other words, ArtShare will allow you to easily publish your art and give you all the positive things that comes with a publisher without taking a big cut of your profits.
