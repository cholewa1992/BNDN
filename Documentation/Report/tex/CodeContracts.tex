\section{Erroneous states}

In trying to prevent implementation errors from leading to runtime errors, Code Contracts\footnote{Microsoft Research plug-in for .NET} have been implemented for variable checking.

Code Contracts can be used in several ways. We have chosen to use Contracts with chosen exceptions.

 \texttt{Contract.Requires<ArgumentException>(argument != null);}
 
We have chosen to use Code Contracts over if-then-throw for two reasons mainly; Readability and control. Readability needs no justification

Our assemblies are compiled with full runtime checking, which means that all our team needs Code Contracts installed in order to work on our source code.

why do we do it??
where do we use it
