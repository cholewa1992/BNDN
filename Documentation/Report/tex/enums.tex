Since the data model was designed to be as generic as possible a decision needed to be made on how to best reflect this in the DTOs.
The following three approaches were considered:
\begin{itemize}
\item Using inheritance to model the differences between the different \textit{Media Type}s.
\item Using strings to represent the different \textit{Media Type}s and types of \textit{Media Information}.
\item Using enums to represent the different \textit{Media Type}s and types of \textit{Media Information}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Inheritance}
Using inheritance to model the differences between different \textit{Media Type}s had the advantage of allowing the use of polymorphism to make collections of \textit{Media Item} objects and passing them as result for e.g. the search function. Adding a new type would then simply be a matter of creating a new subtype as depicted on figure~\ref{fig:dto_inheritance}.
 
However, this approach did not take advantage of the flexibility of the data model.\textit{ShareIt} would have to define which properties each of the different \textit{Media Type}s had, thus forcing the \textit{Client}s to use its definition of each type.

\subsubsection{Using strings to represent types}
Using strings to represent the different \textit{Media Type}s and  types of \textit{Media Information} had the advantage of making full use of the flexibility of the data model. The various \textit{Client}s would be able to define their own types simply by deciding on a name for them. 

However, this would potentially be very costly for the services. In order to create the correct relations in the database queries would have to be made for every piece of \textit{Media Information} to try and match the Type string with an EntityInfoType in the database. If no match could be found a new EntityInfoType would have to be created and stored. This would be extra cumbersome because spelling would not be ensured across calls and the values \textit{``title''} and \textit{``Title''} would not be the same.

\subsubsection{Using enums to represent types}
The middle ground between flexibility and type safety was sought by using enums to represent types instead of strings.
The DTOs were still flexible enough that the \textit{Client}s were able to define which information they wanted each \textit{Media Item} to hold, but it was ensured that the different information could only have a type specified by \textit{ShareIt}.

In order to support the addition of new types to the database an invariant was enforced making sure that the value of the enums matched the corresponding id in the database. 
This meant that the enums could be cast to integers when saving data in the database and vice versa when retrieving data from the database.
