While the purpose of the system is to provide functionality for end-users to purchase media from each other there are a number of issues which are out of scope. 

In particular any legal issues are out of scope. This means that there will not be implemented any method securing that uploaded media is in fact the intellectual property of the uploader. 

Additionally there will not be focus on secure transactions of data and secure storage of user password i.e. it is out of scope to implement encryption of data being transmitted between client and server as well and encrypting and hashing user password before they are stored in the database. 

Lastly it is out of scope to handle actual payment of the media being sold.
