The system consists of a client(ArtShare) and a server(ShareIt). 
The Client consists mainly ASP.NET MVC with an added layer which acts as a bridge between ASP.NET MVC and the services provided by ShareIt. 
ShareIt uses a three-layered architecture where the top layer is the WCF Services, the middle layer is the Business Logic Layer and the lower layer is the Data Access Layer.
