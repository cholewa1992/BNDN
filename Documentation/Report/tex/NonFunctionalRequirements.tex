\subsection{Usability}

\begin{enumerate}[label=U\arabic*:]
\item The client must have an intutive user interface
\item Without prior knowlegde to the client, a user must be able to
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item{Create a user within 5 minutes}
	\item Search for media within 1 minutes
	\item Purchase media files within 3 minutes
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Reliability}

\begin{enumerate}[label=R\arabic*:]
\item If the connection to ShareIT is lost for any reason, the client must not crash. 
\item In case of failure the client must provide extensive error messages, such that the user can understand and react to it accordingly.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Performance}

\begin{enumerate}[label=P\arabic*:]
\item The user must not experience a delay of more than 5 seconds on any operation, assuming that the user has an internet connection of at least 2 Mbit/s
\item The client should support at least 10 concurrent users. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Supportability}

\begin{enumerate}[label=S\arabic*:]
\item Developers must be able to extend the functionality of the client without talking to the original developer. 
\item Extensions to the client requires that the code is well written and documented. 
\item Extensions might require a temporary shutdown of the web service.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Implementation}
\begin{enumerate}[label=Im\arabic*:]
\item The client is developed in ASP.NET and is accessible through a web browser.
\item System requirements


\begin{tabular}{| l | l | }
\hline
 Execution environment & Internet Explorer v10+\\
& Google Chrome v31+\\
& Webkit v2.0+\\ \hline
 Processer & 1.4 GHz Scorpion or equivalent \\ \hline
 Memory & 512mb RAM  \\ \hline

\end{tabular}

\item For testing purposes it is required that the code is consistent, unambigous and well documented.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Interface}

\begin{enumerate}[label=In\arabic*:]
\item {\color{red}What standards in use by the client should be supported by the system?}
\end{enumerate}
