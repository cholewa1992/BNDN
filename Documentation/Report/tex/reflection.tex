\section{Validation of requirements}

- Lever vi op til kravene(testmatrix)
- Overvejelse om at Search ikke er implementeret på en måde der overholder kravene. Der er altså ikke blevet kigget på krav i implementations perioden

\section{System Architecure}

- Overordnet struktur på backend


\subsection{Implementation}

- Brugen af Dto software startes
- Clienten har dårlig code reuse på nogle punkter, blandt andet pga. datacontract type problemerne

\subsection{Mockups \& Client Architecture}

In the process of defining all the functional requirements of ShareIt and ArtShare, it was decided to produce mockups of the client. These mockups would show all the functionality that the client was ideally throught of having, and thereby functional requirements could be derived from these mockups. You can see some of the created mockups in Appendix \ref{app:mockups}.

- Hvad har mockups gjort for os

\section{Collaboration}

The experience of collaborating with the SMU team has been very interesting and educational, teaching us the importance of clear and precise communication.
It also helped showcase the differences in coding styles and practises, which are not as apparent when working only with ITU students since we are all taught the same practices. 
Despite of the issues along the way it is our impression that the SMU team was satisfied with the collaboration and so were we.
