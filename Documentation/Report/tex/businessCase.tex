\section{Business case}

It is difficult to break through as an artist. We aim to accommodate this problem. Money is often a barrier as it is fairly expensive to release your work if you are not signed to a publisher. At the same time is difficult to get signed by a publisher since they will not sign a contract with an artist unless they are certain that there is a market for the art that the artist produces. Additionally if you get a contract with a publisher they will take a big cut of your profits. This often results in work never being published.\\

\noindent We want to supply a platform for artists to independently publish their work without having a huge portion of their profits devoured by the publisher. To maximise the artists' profit the platform will allow anyone to publish their own art and make it available for everyone to buy and enjoy. Whether it is movies, music, literature or any other form of digital art.\\


\noindent Furthermore the platform should provide easy promotion of art which is popular among its users through its own promotion techniques as well as integration with various social media outlets

%Our platform will facilitate a growth in the publication of art which is beneficial for cultural growth, but also benefit both artist and consumer by maximizing the artists profit and making the product cheaper for the consumer.
